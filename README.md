Mini projects I work on during my spare time

This calculator allows one to perform basic computations on two numbers, 
such as multiplication, division, addition, subtraction and converting a number
to its binary equivalent.

Pi Calculator

This calculator computes pi in decimal places specified by the user.

Story Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The story game starts off the game with a sentence.
Players will then take turns to add one sentence at a time to the story.
The story can be read and will slowly appear on the screen a line at a time.

Account Manager

This program allows one to create accounts with a username and password.
The registered user may then proceed to log in.
The system will show that the user has logged in successfully at the current time.
